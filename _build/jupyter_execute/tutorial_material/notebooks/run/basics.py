# # Running ADF Basics
# 
# Now that the environment is setup with the required modules loaded and the ADF cloned let's put it all together and do a CAM vs CAM comparison!

# ## How to run the ADF
# 
# There are two ways to run the ADF, the first and most stright forward is runnning the ADF in the terminal and the second is via Jupyter.
# 
# The first steps are to set the desired (and required) variables in the config yaml file(s). In this demo, we will run the ADF standard variable defaults file (`adf_variable_defaults.yaml`), but feel free to explore making your own, please refer back to the <a href="https://justin-richling.github.io/ADF-Tutorial/notebooks/intro/yaml/adf_variable_defaults.html" target="_blank">Variable Defaults</a> yaml section.

# 
# ## Types of ADF Comparisons
# 
# There are a couple different ADF runs one can do:
# 
# <p>Single Case Comparison</p>
# <p>Multiple Case Comparison**</p>
# <p style="margin-top: -15px;">&ensp; ** In progress, will not be part of this tutorial currently :(</p>
# 
# ## Available Comparison Cases
# 
# There are essentially 3 types of comparisons:
# 
# * CAM vs CAM
# * CAM vs Observations/Reanalysis
# * CAM vs CMIP
# 
# Each have their own requirements for the run-time config file (eg `config_cam_baseline_example`). The requirements for each type of comparison will be addressed in their respective sections of this tutorial.
