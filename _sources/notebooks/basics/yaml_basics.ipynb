    "\n",
    "There are two ways to run the ADF, the first and most stright forward is runnning the ADF in the terminal and the second is via Jupyter.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first steps are to set the desired (and required) variables in the config yaml file(s). In this demo, we will run the ADF standard variable defaults file (`adf_variable_defaults.yaml`), but feel free to explore making your own, please refer back to the <a href=\"https://justin-richling.github.io/ADF-Tutorial/notebooks/intro/yaml/adf_variable_defaults.html\" target=\"_blank\">Variable Defaults</a> yaml section.\n",

    "* CAM vs Observations/Reanalysis\n",
    "* CAM vs CMIP\n",
