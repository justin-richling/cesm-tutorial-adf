This material is based upon work supported by the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), which is a major facility sponsored by the National Science Foundation (NSF) under Cooperative Agreement No. 1852977. Staff time on this project was also supported by NSF award numbers <???>


The purpose of this tutorial/demo is to give some exposure to what the ADF is and who could benefit from using it. This tutorial is meant to encompass basic to advanced uses of the ADF with guided examples to follow with sample data. It could also be used for a quick how-to for folks eager to try it with their own cases/data. 

There is a reference section that is meant to dive deeper into aspects of the ADF as well as a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) section at the end for some common questions/gotchas that can arise from using the ADF.
